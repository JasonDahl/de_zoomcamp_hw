# Data Engineering Zoomcamp - 2024 Cohort

[DEZoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main "Go to the MLZoomcamp repo") is an educational initiative by [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/ "Go to DataTalksClub's homepage") focused on teaching data engineering. The program covers various topics in data engineering, including ETL, containerization and resource provisioning, workflow orchestration, data warehousing, analytics engineering, and more. DEZoomcamp involves lectures, projects, and real-world applications to provide a comprehensive understanding of data engineering concepts and their practical implementations.

It's curriculum includes several [coding projects](https://github.com/JasonDahl/de_zoomcamp_hw/tree/main "View repo").
